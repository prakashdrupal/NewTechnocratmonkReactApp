                        In fact, studies suggest that over 70% of clicked search results are organic, and 80% of users completely ignore paid advertisements. So, while paid ads are great for driving instant traffic, if youâ€™re looking for a sustainable, medium- to long-term strategy for driving qualified traffic to your website, SEO is the best answer.
